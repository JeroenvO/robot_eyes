Shows eyes on a hackzone badge campzone 2019 https://badge.team

Eyes can play any pattern, like blinking (one or two eyes) and looking around.

Support for an HCSR04 ultrasonic distance sensor is included, to close the eyes if something comes near. To use this, connect the sensor to the top four connection of the six-pin expansion connector. trigger_pin=4, echo_pin=5

Press A to (un)pause (sometimes long press is needed). Press up/down to change color, left/right to change to next/prev pattern.
